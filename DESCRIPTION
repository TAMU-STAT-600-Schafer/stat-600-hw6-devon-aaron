Description: This package implements Multiclass Logistic Regression using the
  Damped Newtons Method and the Kmeans clustering with the Lloyd algorithm.
  The functions LRMultiClass() and MyKmeans() are wrapper functions for these
  implementations and are primary functionality of this package. The source code
  of this package is written in Rcpp to allow for faster computations.
